# Journal Entry

This will create a simple markdown page for the given day for you to jot down your thoughts.

It is also primarily used to track this so at the end of the year you can easily figure out what you did

Running `cargo install journal_entry` will allow you to run `journal_entry while will create you a small template for the days thoughts.
